              FootPrints connects us to the people around us by sharing our
              stories- our FootPrints. It’s a bit anti-social network, a bit
              geo-caching, and a bit tiny library. As you interact with the
              community around you, you will collect the FootPrints of others,
              while learning more about those who went that way before, and can
              leave a FootPrint for those yet to come.
              <br />
              <br />
              To get started: <br />
              <ul>
                <li>Create a user account or log in.</li>
                <li>
                  On your profile page, you can create new FootPrints or edit
                  those you’ve already written. You can also see the FootPrints
                  you’ve found while visiting local points of interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Visit the locations on your map. The map will display your
                  current location, indicated by a set of footprints. Points of
                  interest are marked by a blue circle. Once you enter the
                  circle, you will be shown a random FootPrint to enjoy and
                  collect, and can leave a FootPrint of your own.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HowItWorks;
